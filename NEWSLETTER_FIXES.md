# Newsletter Functionality Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to the newsletter functionality in the TechTots STEM store.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Email Delivery**

   - Fixed Brevo API key configuration
   - Created proper store settings required for email templates
   - Fixed email sender format (was using an invalid format)
   - Created test scripts to verify email delivery

2. **Success Notifications**

   - Updated toast notifications to be more visible
   - Added success/error variants with distinct colors
   - Improved the toast component styling
   - Added loading state to the subscription form

3. **Database Storage**
   - Verified newsletter subscribers are properly stored in the database
   - Created script to check newsletter subscribers

## How to Test

1. **Test Email Delivery**

   ```bash
   # Send a test email directly
   node scripts/send-test-email.js your-email@example.com
   ```

2. **Test Newsletter Subscription**

   - Visit the homepage and subscribe using the newsletter form
   - Check your email for the welcome message
   - Run `node scripts/check-newsletter.js` to verify the subscriber was added to the database

3. **Test Toast Notifications**
   - Subscribe to the newsletter with a valid email
   - Try subscribing with an invalid email format
   - Try subscribing with an email that's already subscribed

## Configuration

If you need to update the Brevo API keys or email settings:

```bash
node scripts/setup-brevo.js
```

This will guide you through setting up:

- Brevo API key
- SMTP key (optional)
- Sender email address
- Sender name

## Development vs. Production

- In development mode without API keys, emails are simulated (logged to console)
- In production, real emails are sent via Brevo
- Check the server logs for simulated emails in development mode

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **No Email Received**

   - Check if Brevo API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
   - Verify store settings exist in the database
   - Check if you're in development mode (emails are simulated)
   - Check spam folder

2. **No Success Notification**

   - Make sure the Toaster component is included in the layout
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Restart the development server to apply changes

3. **Subscriber Not Visible in Database**
   - Verify the API response is successful
   - Check if the Newsletter model migration has been applied
   - Run `node scripts/check-newsletter.js` to view subscribers
