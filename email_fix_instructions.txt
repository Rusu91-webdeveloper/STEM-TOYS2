To fix the email issue, you need to generate an App Password from your Google account. Here's how:
1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Click on 'Security'
3. Under 'Signing in to Google', click on '2-Step Verification'
4. Scroll to the bottom and click on 'App passwords'
5. Select 'Mail' as the app and 'Other' as the device (name it 'TechTots')
6. Click 'Generate' and Google will create a 16-character password
7. Copy this password and update your .env.local file:
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=webira.rem.srl@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   EMAIL_FROM=TechTots Toys <webira.rem.srl@gmail.com>
8. After updating, restart your development server with 'npm run dev'
