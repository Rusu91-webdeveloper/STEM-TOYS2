# Blog Creation Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the blog creation issue in the admin panel, which was returning a 500 error with:

```json
{ "error": "Failed to create blog post" }
```

## Changes Made

1. **Improved Error Handling**: Updated the API route to provide more detailed error information.

   - File: `/app/api/blog/route.ts`
   - Added detailed error information in the 500 error response, including error message and code.

2. **Fixed Prisma Client Import**: Replaced direct PrismaClient instantiation with the singleton instance from `/lib/db.ts`.

   - File: `/app/api/blog/route.ts`
   - Changed from `new PrismaClient()` to `import { db } from "@/lib/db"` to avoid connection pool issues.

3. **Added Metadata Handling**: Ensured the metadata field is properly initialized.

   - File: `/app/api/blog/route.ts`
   - Added default metadata values to prevent errors with JSON serialization.

4. **Enhanced Client-Side Error Display**: Improved the error display in the admin UI.

   - File: `/app/admin/blog/new/page.tsx`
   - Enhanced error handling to show more detailed error messages from the server.

5. **Created Debug Script**: Added a utility script to help debug blog creation issues.
   - File: `/scripts/debug-blog-creation.js`
   - This script can be run to test blog creation directly against the database and diagnose issues.

## How to Test the Fix

1. Deploy the changes to your environment.

2. Try creating a new blog post in the admin panel at `/admin/blog/new`.

3. If you still encounter issues, run the debug script:

   ```bash
   node scripts/debug-blog-creation.js
   ```

4. The script will provide detailed information about what might be causing the issue, including:
   - Whether an admin user exists in the database
   - Whether categories exist in the database
   - Any database errors that occur during blog creation

## Common Issues

1. **Missing Admin User**: The blog creation requires a valid admin user in the database.

2. **Missing Categories**: Make sure you have created at least one category that can be selected for the blog post.

3. **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure your database connection string is correct and the database is accessible.

4. **Unique Constraint Violations**: Ensure the blog slug is unique.

## Additional Troubleshooting

If issues persist, check the server logs for more detailed error information. The enhanced error handling added in this fix should provide more context about what's going wrong.
